    <h2> Isabel Buosi</h2>
    <p>I am a Computer Science student, currently in my 5th semester, with a strong interest in technology and gaming. From an early age, I have always enjoyed exploring the world of video games with my friends, where we find fun and challenges that keep us connected. I value my time at home, where I feel most comfortable studying, playing games, and spending time with the people I care about. However, I also enjoy going out occasionally, especially once a month with my best friend. Additionally, I work alongside my parents in our family business, which allows me to develop various skills and contribute to the daily operations.</p>
