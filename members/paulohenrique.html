                <h2 class="text-paulo"><strong>Paulo Henrique</strong></h2>
                <p class="text-paulo2">I'm a 24-year-old Computer Science student and I have a great passion for
                    technology.
                    Since I
                    was little, I've always been fascinated by how things work and how we can use them to improve our
                    daily
                    lives.
                    The world of online gaming especially captivates me; I love getting involved in different universes
                    and
                    challenges that these games offer, always looking for new adventures and experiences.
                    Furthermore, I am an unconditional fan of science fiction films. I believe that these films not only
                    entertain,
                    but also spark the imagination and make us reflect on the future and possibilities of technology.
                    Despite all
                    these passions, I prefer to stay at home, where I can dedicate myself to studying, playing and
                    exploring
                    new
                    ideas and projects. For me, the comfort of home is the perfect setting to immerse myself in
                    everything I
                    love.
